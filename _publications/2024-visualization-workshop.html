The ubiquity of data visualization across various domains—from data science and machine learning to business intelligence, medical science, and education—demonstrates its critical role in conveying complex information. However, it is now well-known that visualizations may create inequitable access to information for people with different disabilities (e.g., vision, motor, or cognitive disabilities). Building on the growing interest and open challenges at this intersection, the in-person Accessible Data Visualization (AccessViz) workshop aims to gather researchers, practitioners, and representatives from disability community at a common platform where we can formulate a community, share innovative discoveries, and envision the future of accessible data visualization research.
