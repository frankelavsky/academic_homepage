title: "Exploring The Affordances of Game-Aware Streaming to Support Blind and Low Vision Viewers: A Design Probe Study"
tweet: Games offer the ability to adjust accessibility settings, but what about streamers viewing a stream? In this design probe, we explore the possibility of customizing streaming interfaces using game data streamed directly to the end user.

This paper explores new ways to support blind and low vision (BLV) game stream participants. Prior work on game-aware streaming systems has focused on the potential for viewer interaction and personalization for sighted viewers, but how such systems impact interaction and personalization for BLV viewers remains largely unexplored. Most streaming experiences have significant visual information but no non-visual or sensemaking alternatives, which can exclude BLV viewers from understanding and interacting with the streaming experience. Building on the pre-existing system MARS, we developed a design probe that makes game data available to stream viewers in personalizable visual and non-visual formats. We use this probe to investigate the needs of BLV game stream viewers through qualitative interviews and live prototype testing sessions on Twitch. In addition to the technical contributions of our probe, our work addresses how game-aware streaming technologies can align with the needs and motivations of BLV viewers, and paves the way for novel designs in future iterations of game-aware streaming technologies.
