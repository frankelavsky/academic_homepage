      <p>Academic, peer-reviewed “short” papers are a common way to present a
      late-breaking work to the academic community that outlines preliminary
      findings, research ideas, and novel conversations. By comparison,
      blogging or writing posts on social media are an unstructured and open
      way to discuss ideas and start new conversations. Both have limitations
      in the proliferation of research ideas. The short paper format relies on
      the conference and journal submission process while blogging does not
      operate within a structured format or set of expectations at all.
      However, at times the demand exists for late-breaking ideas and
      conversations to arise in a raw form or with urgency but should still be
      archived and recorded in a way that promotes citational honesty and
      integrity. To address this, I present: The Micro-Paper, as a micro-paper
      itself. The Micro-Paper is a small, cheap, accessible, digital document
      that is self-published and archived, akin to a pre-print of a short
      paper. This meta micro-paper discusses the context, goals, and
      considerations of micro-paper authoring.</p>

      <p><strong>Fig 1:</strong> The micro-paper fills a gap on the spectrum
      between fast, cheap ideas and rigorous, archival work.</p>
      <h1 id="what-is-a-micro-paper">1. What is a micro-paper?</h1>
      <p>A micro-paper is a paper between 1 and 4 pages in length that engages
      a single idea clearly. A micro-paper can be anything from focused blog
      post to a preprinted short paper, but it is published through an open
      archive.</p>
      <h1 id="the-context-of-micro-papers">2. The context of micro-papers</h1>
      <p>Ideas and conversations often arise in research settings in response
      to problems, gaps, or issues. But some ideas and conversations also come
      about in a more generative fashion: they are still responding to
      something within a context but are not concerned with problems and gaps.
      So, whether filling gaps or otherwise, a micro-paper (and even the
      authors at times) must clearly and reflexively be situated within a
      conversational context.</p>
      <p>At a meta-level, this paper <em>is</em> framed as a gap-filler (see:
      Fig 1). Currently, academic publishing is expensive, time-consuming, and
      high risk. And while much of the process could be argued as a necessary
      set of procedures to ensure we aren’t making claims that are misleading
      or unfounded, there exists a gap for disseminating ideas that should be
      cheap, accessible, and intended to inspire other work [<a href="#ref-Mastroianni2" id="Mastroianni2-1" aria-label="4, Mastroianni, Things Could Be Better." title="4, Mastroianni, Things Could Be Better." role="doc-noteref">4</a>]. Not all
      research conversation needs to have answers. The heart of research as a
      community is due to the dissemination of ideas that aren’t only
      congealed or refined, but raw and messy as well.</p>
      <p>Generally, the gap for disseminating cheap ideas is filled by
      academics today through Twitter, blogging, or in some form of social
      media or another. Sometimes the gap is filled through workshops,
      position papers, or conversation pieces (such as ACM’s Interactions).
      There are many options for sharing ideas, all with different tradeoffs
      between editorial and authoring expenses, time, archiving,
      accessibility, and democratization of the process.</p>
      <h1
      id="a-micro-papers-goal-is-the-free-cheap-open-and-honest-dissemination-of-ideas">3.
      A micro-paper’s goal is the free, cheap, open, and honest dissemination
      of ideas</h1>
      <p>The micro-paper’s focus is on <em>ideas</em> for the sake of
      generative work, conversation, and inspiration. In contrast, a
      micro-paper is not an appropriate venue for sharing findings, claims, or
      experiments. The nature of methodological generation of knowledge is
      most trustworthy when there is a more rigorous process in place. Some
      avenues generate <em>good</em> or <em>trustworthy</em> knowledge and
      ideas, but the micro-paper is a place for sharing <em>potentially</em>
      <em>useful</em> ideas. Good or trustworthy knowledge may require more
      careful review [<a href="#ref-Mastroianni1" id="Mastroianni1-1" aria-label="3, Mastroianni, The rise and fall." title="3, Mastroianni, The rise and fall." role="doc-noteref">3</a>, <a href="#ref-Mastroianni2" id="Mastroianni2-2" aria-label="4, Mastroianni, Things Could be Better." title="4, Mastroianni, Things Could be Better." role="doc-noteref">4</a>, <a href="#ref-Why" id="Why-1" aria-label="6, Why Do People Publish." title="6, Why Do People Publish." role="doc-noteref">6</a>], but potentially useful ideas should at least
      be archived.</p>
      <h2 id="a-micro-paper-must-be-small-and-cheap">3.1 A micro-paper must be
      small and cheap</h2>
      <p>Whether having peer-reviewed work or an editorial team, most writing
      is costly in both time and money. It is also risky: your work could get
      rejected or require slow iterations of feedback and review.</p>
      <p>In contrast, this micro-paper took me 3 hours on a random Thursday in
      February (when I should be crunching for another deadline). Most
      micro-papers should ideally be short enough in length to encourage both
      rapid authoring and reading.</p>
      <h2 id="a-micro-paper-must-be-archived">3.2 A micro-paper must be
      archived</h2>
      <p>While blogging and tweeting is cheap and fast and encourages ideas to
      be shared, these aren’t trustworthy archives. And sometimes good ideas
      arise in these faster, cheaper contexts that should be captured,
      articulated, and stored for later reference. With the existential threat
      of twitter disintegrating at any moment and the entirely unmaintained
      space of many academic blogs, it is important for some ideas to be
      archived [<a href="#ref-Sanderson" id="Sanderson-1" aria-label="5, Sanderson, Analyzing the Persistence." title="5, Sanderson, Analyzing the Persistence." role="doc-noteref">5</a>].</p>
      <p>While some blog maintainers may have higher standards for their
      longevity, url stability, dois, and records of changes, it may make
      sense for most to use an existing pre-print archival platform, like
      arXiv for ensuring trustworthiness and reliability in your readers.</p>
      <h2 id="revisions-must-also-be-archived">3.3 Revisions must also be
      archived</h2>
      <p>In addition to archival processes for the sake of accessing later,
      many archival sites (such as arXiv) also keep track of revision
      histories. The ephemeral and non-standardized way that individuals
      operate their own blogs and social media means that not only might
      something move or cease to exist (a findability problem) but there is
      also an honesty problem when contents change or update without record
      [<a href="#ref-Zittrain" id="Zittrain-1" aria-label="7, Zittrain, Perma: Scoping and Addressing." title="7, Zittrain, Perma: Scoping and Addressing." role="doc-noteref">7</a>].</p>
      <h2 id="a-micro-paper-must-be-accessible">3.4 A micro-paper must be
      accessible</h2>
      <p>Blogs, twitter, and mastodon have done more for disability discourse
      than most other media, but especially more than the dreaded PDF favored
      by academics. This is because text-based media online (generally in HTML
      or Markdown) has immense accessibility potential over PDF [<a href="#ref-Bigham" id="Bigham-1" aria-label="1, Bigham, An Uninteresting Tour." title="1, Bigham, An Uninteresting Tour." role="doc-noteref">1</a>] (and paper
      publications). All artifacts of academic discourse, including every
      paper publication, should be more accessible. Due to a micro-paper’s
      size, it is easier for authors to learn accessibility for than a
      full-size paper with proprietary formatting involved. This micro-paper
      was authored in Microsoft Word, exported as a PDF, and then converted
      into HTML using pandoc.</p>
      <p>With the push for arXiv to transition more towards accessible formats
      of publication [<a href="#ref-Brinn" id="Brinn-1" aria-label="2, Brinn, A framework for improving." title="2, Brinn, A framework for improving." role="doc-noteref">2</a>], I believe that trustworthy archives that are
      accessibility-first are near. Micro-papers will compliment this
      push.</p>
      <h1
      id="considering-when-a-micro-paper-is-the-write-choice-pun-intended">4.
      Considering when a micro-paper is the write choice (pun intended)</h1>
      <p>If someone has an idea, conversation, or late-breaking work, they
      might consider the following questions:</p>
      <p><em>Why wouldn’t I write a short academic paper and submit to a
      traditional venue?</em></p>
      <p>It is time-consuming, expensive, and requires waiting for the
      publication cycle. It is also higher risk, in cases where the peer
      review process might reject it.</p>
      <p><em>Why shouldn’t I write a piece in a non-peer reviewed publication,
      like ACM Interactions?</em></p>
      <p>This is also time-consuming and higher risk, because editorial
      interest may conflict. In addition, these often require an existing
      network of colleagues, invitation to contribute, or formal submission
      and selection process.</p>
      <p><em>Why shouldn’t I write a blog or twitter thread?</em></p>
      <p>Blogs and social media posts raise concerns about archival quality
      and trustworthiness. Accessing the piece later may become difficult or
      cumbersome. Some great ideas and discussions have been lost in time due
      to the ephemeral nature of these cheap and fast options.</p>
      <p><em>When is writing a micro-paper a good idea?</em></p>
      <p>Notably, there is no formal peer review for a micro-paper. Our
      currently imagined peer review process may not make sense for all work
      published with the intent to push new ideas and conversations. It is
      even worth considering if this practice should continue at all [<a href="#ref-Mastroianni1" id="Mastroianni1-2" aria-label="3, Mastroianni, The rise and fall." title="3, Mastroianni, The rise and fall." role="doc-noteref">3</a>,
      <a href="#ref-Mastroianni2" id="Mastroianni2-3" aria-label="4, Mastroianni, Things Could be Better." title="4, Mastroianni, Things Could be Better." role="doc-noteref">4</a>].</p>
      <p>A practical use for a micro-paper may be as a preprint or early draft
      for an eventual short or full paper submission, position paper, or book
      chapter. The greatest strength of both the pre-print and short paper
      process is that they can invigorate scholars with new or raw ideas to
      see those turn into full projects. Short papers also have a core
      readership and opportunities to present that are not afforded to
      micro-papers, so for early career researchers it may be important to
      consider ways to use these two formats together.</p>
      <p>For folks who simply want to get a citable idea out into the world
      without regard for submission and publication cycles and procedures, a
      micro-paper is a good choice as well.</p>
      <p>And lastly, there may be authors with too many ideas to pursue (even
      when some are useful) and they are willing to admit that they won’t
      pursue every idea that they have. A micro-paper is a way to put the idea
      into the discussion and let it run its course. In my case, I recognize
      that some problems and patterns are outside of the scope of my leverage
      and experience to address, such as contributions to design or behavioral
      domains of accessibility (when my area is strictly technical
      contributions).</p>
      <h1 id="conclusion">5. Conclusion</h1>
      <p>The hope is that both the procedural and systemic inaccessibility of
      the short paper authoring process and the citational uncertainty of
      blogs and social media can be addressed with the micro-paper. I hope to
      see early, usable ideas shared more freely and especially hope to
      invigorate young scholars and include historically excluded folks, such
      as those with disabilities, in the larger research conversation.</p>
      <h1 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h1>
      <p>Special thanks to Jonathan Zong, for your encouragement to make my
      cheap ideas citable and for feedback on this micro-paper. Also thanks to
      the folks at the MIT Vis Lab (Arvind, Crystal, and Alan) for supporting
      my not-traditionally-publishable ideas over the past couple years
      especially. Hearing that my “tweets are a public service” encouraged me
      to make the heart of that service last longer than Twitter does
      (hopefully).</p>
