description: A right that I had as a disabled student in the US is at risk of being destroyed.

The [Disability Rights and Education Fund has a great write-up](https://dredf.org/protect-504/) on what Section 504 is and what is happening here in the US, in the legal scene. In short: 17 States are suing the US government to get rights for students with disabilities taken away. This is devastating.

I would arguably not be alive today if it wasn't for Section 504 and even if I was, I certainly wouldn't have been able to have such a wonderfully fulfilling career at places like Apple, Adobe, Highsoft, Visa, and a PhD at one of the top computer science schools in the world. I have had such a wonderful life in recent years, but there is no way these things would have been possible without Section 504.

I missed over 90 days of school (more than half of the school year) during my junior and senior years. I have a debilitating condition where my immune system attacks my body. I've had numerous surgeries and I've had to have whole organs removed. But I wouldn't have been able to finish school if there wasn't a government-mandated set of rights and plans in place for disabled students like me.

In 2006, my mother was a (then newly-retired) school teacher who understood that I should have an accommodations plan made. She helped the district (who was quite resistant!) put it together for me. Even in a liberal town in the liberal state of Washington, Section 504 was hard-fought. But we got a plan in place.

My senior year ('07 to '08) was when they enacted my alternative learning plan, which allowed me to work largely in an independent role from home, going to alternative school for a few hours per week. Negotiating for this kind of flexibility would have been impossible without it being enshrined with some degree of legal protection. I know this because during my time in industry, I was never able to really get the flexibility I needed. Companies, even during covid, weren't too keen on people living a flexible life.

Section 504 is what mandated this as a right that I had, as a student in this country. This accommodation plan, no joke, helped pave the course of my entire life. I finished high school, albeit with bad grades but I finished. I wouldn't have been able to do it without Section 504.

My diploma was necessary for me to get into college at age 21 and then get a job with health insurance at age 26 (just after the Obamacare age cutoff). Any later and I would have had an insurance gap, which could very easily have been game over for me.

I want there to be future generations of Franks in the world who have a shot like I did. And attacking 504 will devastate so many students. It also is a moral stain on what our country *should* stand for. Laws that empower people are the kind of laws we need. 504 *generated* freedoms for me that I never would have had. 504 may have felt like "less freedom" for institutions, but laws should always serve people over structures. We need to protect 504 and even go further to strengthen it, make it better, and even have these rights spread into industry and corporate spaces.
