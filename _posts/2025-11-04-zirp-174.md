I saw a chart going around on social media with "chatGPT released" overlaid on data showing two lines: the SP 500 and Total Job Openings. I added two new annotations (174 and ZIRP) to add more context:

<figure>
    <img src="https://www.frank.computer/images/zirp-174.jpg" alt="Total job openings and s&p 500 from 2003 to the present. Jobs and the stock market track closely together until 2022, when they diverge (stocks rapidly rise and jobs rapidly fall). Overlaid are 3 annotations: section 174 kicking in 1/1/22, ZIRP ends 3/1/22, and Chat GPT released in december of 22." style="display: block; width: 60%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
    <figcaption>This chart has gone absolutely viral on multiple social medias (facebook, threads, twitter, bluesky, and so on). The original annotation (for GPT) isn't just a "correlation does not equal causation" issue but more of a problem like, "sensation does not equal causation" (a problem of our times, it seems).</figcaption>
</figure>

First off, job openings clearly were being hit before the release of GPT (and so was the stock market). The downturn had already begun. Knowing why one recovered and the other didn't is key. And this is partly, if not majorly, because §174 kicked in Jan 1st of 2022 and was followed by our short, post-covid ZIRP effectively ending in Mar of 2022. Those two have been devastating for tech workers.

I am, by no means an expert, which is also why my alarm bells have been going off for years any time someone has offered the seemingly simple explanation that AI is taking jobs.

Really? Just AI? That's too convenient. Do you really trust that's how the world works? Nothing is ever that simple. It's probably even more complex than ZIRP, 174, and AI combined. It always is. Interrogate your charts, people!

(That being said, chatGPT and the modern AI *griftrastructure* very likely explains why the stock market is going up - but not why jobs haven't recovered!)
