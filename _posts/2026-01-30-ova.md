And please, go and view the whole course online over at the [Open Visualization Academy](https://openvisualizationacademy.org/courses/accessibility-in-data-visualization/introduction/introduction/).

As part of the release, I also helped to audit and give feedback on the accessibility of the Open Visualization Academy, which you can find more details about in their [accessibility statement](https://openvisualizationacademy.org/accessibility/).
