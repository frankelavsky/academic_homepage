description: The more I think about myself and why I do the things I do, the more I recognize that I love systems with depth. I love systems specifically that enable possibilities through constraints. This is partially why I like numbers or visualizing data, but more to do with why I love games and tool-making.

Most quiet moments I get to stew on things, these sorts of thoughts crop up: "Why do I love visualization toolmaking?" and "Why have I spent the majority of my life designing tabletop rpg systems that about 20 people have actually been able to thoroughly enjoy?" Both have answers in *systems.*

I love systems that have depth to them. And I love how systems can enable people to do things that they otherwise wouldn't have cared about or been able to do otherwise. Systems create spaces of possibility through our interaction with them in the same way that [Huizinga wrote about the "magic circles" of play and games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_Ludens).

There is something about *long-term* relationships between people and systems that is really satisfying to me. Players of my ttrpg will learn the ins and outs of character building, optimizing turns in combat, and treasure-hunting. I designed my subsystems to be deep, expansive, and rewarding to encourage this long-term strategization. I've been honing my game for years! It's on version 7+ and I've got at least [two whole books](https://www.lulu.com/search?contributor=Frank+Elavsky) (more than 450 pages) that my players have purchased as well as the core rulebook that I use (with another 150 pages or so). This is a project that has become a love of how people learn to play with systems over decades.

And in toolmaking (which is what I do professionally, since the game-making thing is just a hobby) I recognize that many people actually love tools. And people also will often resist *new* tools. For example, because I do a lot of consultation work with professionals in the realm of accessibility, it is clear that many who specialize in something like data visualization or interactive data science don't want to learn a new tool in addition to learning a domain like accessibility. People often prefer to make their existing tools work. I've seen this behavior in all kinds of other communities too: like the "js in html" movement or using python to do things with a web frontend that are an affront to god.

Actually, my [Data Navigator](https://dig.cmu.edu/data-navigator/) project was intentionally designed with this kind of resistance in mind. It was designed as a system that could integrate *into* other systems. And I wanted this to be a tool with immense design potential + depth. I expect folks won't do cool things with it right away, but in time we might see some really curious stuff emerge!

A lot of studies and design philosophies for interfaces and systems seem short-sighted to me. These short sighted studies reward faster interactions and quick paths to reach simple outcomes. This makes our interface systems shallow. But I love how people become accustomed to systems and adapt and optimize their behavior. People gain a sense of *preference* over time. They change their tools and their tools change them. Marshall McLuhan wrote on this, "**We become what we behold. We shape our tools and then our tools shape us.**" I'm especially interested in how this happens to us over time.

Some people *like* these longer-term relationships with systems. I know that I do. I still use vanilla javascript for this reason, as offensive as that has been to many people over the years. But this long-term enjoyment of a system or tool feels akin to how some talk about tools of craftwork and how folks will grow sentimental to the tools they've used for decades. From a work perspective, it is hard to design a research study (unless it is really longitudinal) around how people embed themselves into systems. But I love systems that are designed with long-term, deep use in mind. Some video games have this built in, but tools like Photoshop do too.

</figure>

The interface of a tool like Photoshop is immensely deep and complex. It can take a decade to learn the ins and outs of everything it can do and what is useful to a beginner or short-term user might influence the design in a direction that a longer-term, deep-expertise user might not prefer.

The more people like to use a system, the more that they may want to personalize or customize it. They might recognize that the default design behavior or appearance of certain things isn't quite what they'd like it to be. And one thing that I've learned from long-term use of systems is how much pretty much anybody who has committed to a tool or system likes to do this. From specialized equipment in workplaces, to user interfaces in gaming and software, long term use always involves a mix of adaptation of the user and the system.

People don't just make adaptations to their systems and tools but also can adapt to fit systems over time. I have a blog post draft that has been in my drafts since early Spring of this year (2024) about how I learned to "parse" well in raiding in World of Warcraft. It has a lot to do with learning optimal behaviors, understanding how the mathematical systems work, and also understanding how others (who you compete against) use the systems and tools available to them.

Originally, the draft post on "parsing" was about how I hit the [number 1 spot in the entire world for my raid performance in a particular season](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/character/us/wyrmrest-accord/merovegas?zone=35#difficulty=3).

<figure>

    <figcaption>I hit number 1 in the world for an entire season when Amirdrassil was out, out of tens of thousands of competitors. (Note Rank 2 and 5 in the seasons and raids leading up to it too!)</figcaption>
</figure>

That's a pretty big deal! I beat out people who play World of Warcraft professionally and I did it by "pugging" (which means to play with random people on your team, a significant disadvantage).

This news seemed like a fun thing to announce to folks who might not know this side of me. But as I was drafting this announcement, I kept putting it off. I stewed on it for weeks (and eventually months). My draft kept growing and changing and I kept wanting to explain my favorite part of this victory: how I carefully came to understand how the combat, parsing, raid mechanics, and other systems worked so that I could take that top spot. I was running analytical simulations, reading complex reports, checking in with fellow competitors and optimizers, literally making spreadsheets and writing custom code, all so that I could find what optimal outcomes were possible. And I learned how to play the game a particular way because I came to know the system more and more at a deeper level. I even took the top spot intentionally on the final day of the season, so that nobody would be able to beat me in subsequent days. It was a very dramatic time in life for me and my small group of friends who I play with online.

This is often called the "meta" ranking, which tends to determine which class people end up playing the most (because people like to play whatever is the strongest at that moment in time). I play an Arms Warrior, which tends to be near the bottom of these (I love the commitment, plus feeling like an underdog). This is from a season when we are near the middle of the pack (one of the brown bars below the middle). Not a bad time for us, relatively speaking.</figcaption>

While I haven't quite locked in on what I want to talk about in that draft yet, it now makes me realize that my love of gaming is often about my love of the *systems* underneath that game. How do the mechanics work? How do the numbers work? How can I optimize and engineer for a perfect outcome? I love video games and franchises like Balatro, Vampire Survivors, Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Dark Souls/Elden Ring/Bloodborne, and more largely because there are math/mechanical subsystems underneath the game that I love to mess around with and challenge myself to beat or overcome.

So, I think I'm in love with systems and how systems make us *feel* when we use them over time. I love my own relationships to complex, challenging things that I can take my time with. When data visualization practitioners devote their entire lives to a singular craft (visualizing data) instead of rotating around and picking up whichever new technique or tool is cutting edge, I get interested. I love knowing about *specialization* and folks who intentionally choose deep expertise over broad exposure. I *especially* love to hear when folks stick with an "underdog," like how I have loved playing an Arms Warrior for almost 2 decades or how someone still chooses to use matplotlib in python because it is simply what they prefer using the most.

The tools we use and the systems we interact with mean a lot to us. We may not always even make practical decisions with them or about them. I think that is beautifully human to admit! (That being said, I also love how people adapt systems that are not always practical into more practical things. Take how [Chris DeMartini made keyboard navigation of visualizations possible in Tableau](https://www.datablick.com/blog/2021/8/10/a-tableau-accessibility-journey-part-iv-keyboard-accessibility) well before it became part of the software by default. That takes serious dedication and a deep love of a tool to make possible. You can hack a tool to improve it without some degree of love for that tool!)

My parting side-note here is that I also may have realized that I have a dislike of LLMs for reasons that are related to why I love systems. LLMs represent all the benefits of a shallow relationship with a system, to me. Perhaps tooling will improve around LLMs but at its core, I love being able to set up some deterministic outcomes or build functions that can reliably return an output based on some particular inputs. David Pye writes about uncertainty in "The Nature and Art of Workmanship" and I think that there is something to me about certainty gained *aposteriori* that is where I learn to love my tools and systems. I start with a hypothesis or conjecture within the uncertainty of my work and then use tools and systems and games to test them. Afterwards, I can (to some degree) evaluate my hypothesis through the process I chose to employ. But LLMs offer no such testing, evaluation, or inspection. The system is a massive, black-box model of virtually all human language in existence. Prompt "engineers" are really more like prompt "sooth-sayers" in this sense. Knowing with certainty that a particular approach or method is repeatable doesn't exist with LLMs. They use a large scale and multitudes of failure to appraoch ideal outcomes.

Again: my love of systems lies in constraints. And constraints are, in a sense, an intentional scarcity of options. Systems that I love thrive when given fewer choices than infinity.

I love having a sense of *control* and *a posteriori* predictive power over the systems and tools I use and play with. This is because I love using tools over time. The more I hypothesize, test, and learn, the more I gain a close relationship to the tool. My behaviors change. My needs from the tools change. I adapt the tool and it adapts me.

But LLMs carry a sort randomness and lack of control to them because what they offer is infinity. [LLMs are tools for delegation and management](https://www.frank.computer/blog/2024/06/llms-and-thoughts.html) and despite offering infinity, actually [homogenize our creativity](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K3nSFdrKwg4h314skO3kT--Rso3xQ1Dd/view).

Pye mentions in his piece on workmanship that there is always a risk that the worker will ruin a job or mess up whatever they've set out to build or do. Pye doesn't really expand on the economics here, but messing up matters because resources are finite. Tools and relationships to people don't last forever. So this drives a person to pursue excellence. A person seeks to become good at something because there is risk involved when you're bad at something. But because of working within a space of deep constraints, the worker gains skill. And that skill can then provide a means for creatively exploring in ways that may never have been explored otherwise. Once you gain a certain amount of deep expertise, you learn how to do things that seem like pure magic to the uninitiated.

But LLMs offer magic without any risks for failure. The very real scarcity of rising energy demands across the globe are occluded and hidden, made invisible to the user. An LLM is designed precisely with the shallowest, most short-term, zero-risk uses in mind. My conjecture here is that they don't encourage any sort of deep expertise in their use and don't just homogenize creativity but will eventually suffocate and atrophy our collective creativity over time.

So now that I've been stewing on all this for a while, I am getting a sense of what a future blog post should be about. I think that I need to write about what makes for a good system, but focus *purely* on my opinions and subjective preferences. I should write more about which systems *I* love and why. I reckon that even though the world seems to still be enamored by LLMs and whatever new thing is out, there might be more folks out there like me, who spend their time loving for, optimizing, maintaining, improving, and hacking the systems they love. Expect this post to come out eventually (when I can sneak some time in from my current deadline schedule).
