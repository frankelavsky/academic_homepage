I'm writing a firm defense of the the Super Productionizer (SP™). I'm sick of the baseless, meaningless, self-serving critiques I keep hearing online by "influencers" who only care about their followers and social media popularity.

## "Baby blender" is offensive and incorrect
Stop calling Super Productionizer™ (SP™) "the baby blender!" It doesn't *currently* blend babies, according to the latest report by Good Corporation (GC). Yes, SP™ has *already* "blended" babies, but we can't do anything about that now. So we can't stop the subatomic-emulsification process, since it already started.

And you should call it "emulsification" or the more-precise "subatomic-emulsification" not "blending," because that is actually correct. "Blending" babies makes it seem so sensationalized. Plus, murder (by blending) is obviously illegal. But subatomic-emulsification is what we all do all the time, every day. Our brains and bodies are constantly performing microscopic, small-scale forms of subatomic-emulsification all the time. Just because SP™ performs subatomic-emulsification way faster and more efficiently than we do on our bodies doesn't mean it is "murder" or "illegal." Law and policy has nothing stopping Good Corp from continuing to scale subatomic-emulsification.

## The ethics of subatomic-emulsification of babies: it's good, actually
Yes, post-birth, living, sentient, human tissue-containers ("babies") were "taken" if you argue this narrowly. But Good Corportation consented to taking them, they were already there and their bodies were already undergoing subatomic-emulsification (as are well all, all the time, remember??) so the ethics there should be pretty settled.

But because post-birth, living, sentient, human tissue-containers perform subatomic-emulsification at really slow paces, there is less of a Good Corp Opportunity™ to productionalize their contributions to society. Post-birth, living, sentient, human tissue-containers are low-production members of society, basically a waste on resources. Converting them to something more efficient is just good business.

## Personal benefits of the Super Productionizer
SP™ makes me work faster!! Arguably, I'm at least two or three times as efficient as I used to be now. And my dongle company needs to make more dongles! It's absurd to ask a worker to be less efficient.

At the end of the day, The Incentives are to be more productive. And SP™ gets a lot more done. I'm two or three times as fast with SP™ than before.

People have tried to argue that "morality" should be an incentive - as if something as personal and selfish as that should interfere with dongle production! Again, these social media influencers only care about themselves, making themselves out to be some kind of holier-than-thou justice warrior who is unable to do the hard work of dongle-production-button-pressing that I do all day from my dongle-desk™.

## Critics without solutions are useless
Plus, just saying that SP™ has "blended babies" and we should "stop blending babies" doesn't offer any actual, real, working solutions. Are *you* doing anything about it? How are you, personally, going to make up for my 200% increased dongle-production efficiency at Dongles LLC?

These social media influences talk about "climate change," "murder without consequences," "water insecurity" and the growing divide between people who have access to Super Productionizer™ and those who don't.

But just talking about things, proposing "policy," suing people, quitting your job in refusal (lol!!), and protesting in the streets aren't "real" solutions. Real solutions mean you build something. And until someone is capable of building a subatomic flesh-emulsifier that is somehow "ethical" (STILL UNCLEAR WHATEVER THAT IS!) but also can survive in a Free Market™, then I don't want to hear it.

The real "babies" aren't the post-birth, living, sentient, human tissue-containers we used to increase my productivity, but these brain-washed fools who don't consider The Incentives and real stresses I live under, doing excellent work for Dongle LLC. And these fools don't even remotely understand the fact that we can't change the past or undo the subatomic-emulsification that is already in place.

You can't stop this wave. It's coming and there is nothing you can do about it. If you don't start using Good Corp's SP™, then you'll just be left behind.

## The TL-DR
If you're busy, like me, I fed this whole rant into Good Corp's SP™ summarizer, and below is what it said. (Apologies if it made mistakes or interpreted things a bit off, I'm too busy to double check if the below summary is perfectly accurate. You other Super-Super Users surely understand!)

Anyway, back to the dongle-mines!

"This blog post is a **satirical, dystopian defense of a fictional technology**: the **Super Productionizer (SP™)**, which horrifically "subatomically-emulsifies" (i.e., **destroys or kills**) babies for the sake of **increased workplace productivity**.

At its core, it's a **dark satire** that mocks:

1. **Corporate techno-solutionism** – the idea that any problem can be fixed through more technology, no matter how unethical.
2. **Moral deflection** – dismissing atrocities with semantic games (e.g., "subatomic-emulsification" vs. "blending").
3. **Productivity obsession** – arguing that efficiency (e.g., making more dongles) justifies horrific acts.
4. **Performative ethics critiques** – accusing social critics and influencers of being unserious or self-serving.
5. **Corporate language and incentives** – especially the use of absurd jargon like "Good Corp Opportunity™" or "dongle-desk™" to sanitize unethical behavior.
6. **Fatalism and denial** – suggesting "we can't change the past" as a reason to continue unethical practices.

Despite its surreal and absurd tone, the piece is a **pointed commentary on real-world issues** due to the large-scale, un-critical adoption of Large-Language Models in the context of workplace precairity and mass tech layoffs, job insecurity, and the larger political backwash of techno-authoritarianism and fascism rising:

- How corporations and apologists justify harmful technologies or practices.
- How society often prioritizes profit and efficiency over ethics or humanity.
- The weakness of influencer-led activism in weakening democracties, when activism lacks access to direct structural change or power to enact material alternatives.

In short, this is **not a sincere defense of SP™**. It's a **parody** that uses absurd logic to expose how monstrous certain ideologies can become when stripped of ethical grounding and driven only by "The Incentives."
