---

Accessibility overlays are a terrible artifact of our current times. For those who stumble onto my blog and are unaware of what these things are, they are a piece of technology sold to businesses as a one-stop shop for all website accessibility concerns. The entire field of accessibility design and compliance can be solved with one simple, easy-to-swallow pill for only 500 bucks per year.

Yet, overlays consistently [over-promise their capabilities](https://adrianroselli.com/2025/01/ftc-catches-up-to-accessibe.html), [actually produce bad experiences for people with disabilities](https://overlayfactsheet.com/en/), [sue people who write against them](https://adrianroselli.com/2023/05/audioeye-is-suing-me.html), [reduce user privacy](https://overlayfactsheet.com/en/), and [increase your own risk of getting sued](https://adrianroselli.com/2023/02/audioeye-will-get-you-sued.html) for excluding people from being able to use your website.

And yet, businesses still love them (even [people who I've shared resources with end up using them](https://dataliteracy.com/)).

But to me, overlays are like Ivermectin for website accessibility. Instead of taking a vaccine, going to a real doctor, or practicing behaviors that reduce the spread of disease, Ivermectin (sold as a horse de-wormer over the counter) exploded in popularity as a method of dealing with COVID-19 ([link to a NYT gift article on the still-popular craze of Ivermectin use](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/us/ivermectin-conservatives-influencers.html?unlocked_article_code=1._k4.U6mH.4zbJTSnrMAaL&smid=url-share)).

Of course, Ivermectin doesn't cure COVID infection or improve immunity against it either. But people bought Ivermectin like crazy during the pandemic (and still do).

I view accessibility overlays like Ivermectin: they are entirely a grift that enables people to continue to make bad decisions.

See, the thing about Ivermectin isn't just that people chose to consume something that was entirely impotent but that consuming Ivermectin was a way to avoid actually making good decisions about COVID (masking, staying indoors, getting vaccinated, etc). And overlays ultimately, by nature of how they are marketed, enable website designers to remain ignorant about accessibility.

## Nobody wants to admit this: overlays are successful because people are scared of accessibility work (and this is a real business problem)

Overlays operate with a really interesting pitch: "never improve your accessibility, that way we can keep making money off of you by doing it for you." People love this. And honestly? The accessibility community might be a bit to blame for why this pitch seems to work. But first, I want to unpack the basic business proposition overlays make.

Isn't it strange to pay a [yearly subscription to a service](https://accessibe.com/pricing/accesswidget) that doesn't permanently change anything? If you take a step back from website design and accessibility for a moment, ideally the model works like this: you build a website and then people use it. Websites might need occasional maintainence or updating, but most of the work that goes into them is during their initial creation.

But businesses love overlays. "Small to mids" (as we would say back at Visa) seem to be the target market for overlays. The big players like Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Netflix, and so on can't risk something like an overlay. They have in-house experts doing things because overlays aren't worth the litigation.

But smaller companies are terrified: litagation could destroy them. But they don't know where to turn or how to solve something scary like "compliance" or "conformance." Because these business owners operate from a position of scarcity and insecurity when it comes to accessibility, they are more likely to make the wrong decision. Unfortunately, the way scarcity affects our brains isn't unique to business owners either; [we just work this way](https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2015/04/the-science-of-scarcity).

By now (thanks to 2016 here in the US in particular) we have plenty of studies that demonstrate that [economic insecurity is strongly associated with conservative, far-right, and populist voting patterns](https://academic.oup.com/oep/article/75/3/802/6693580). When we get scared and insecure, we tend to end up with worse outcomes.

But I don't argue that "people make bad decisions when they are scared" and that means it is their fault for getting scared but rather, I want to argue that blaming businesses is the wrong approach when it comes to overlays. Yes, a business ultimately makes the decision to use an overlay. And yes, they will ultimately be the one who gets sued when that overlay fails. But business owners are often worried about whether they can afford to do something the right way. And this creates an *opportunity*.

The financial opportunity is so great to overlay companies that they are *willing to get sued* and even *willing to support their customers who get sued*. They make *that much money* off of all this. Overlay companies like accessiBe have a whole support page where they try to assure customers that [even if you get sued, we have enough money and resources to win](https://accessibe.com/litigation-support).

<figure>
    <img src="https://www.frank.computer/images/accessiBe.png" alt="Zero cases lost by accessiBe customers for non-compliance. Screenshot from their website."/>
    <figcaption>I love how accessiBe won't mention that they might get you sued but instead argue that each of their customers who <i>have</i> been sued haven't lost yet. (This was definitely written by a lawyer.)</figcaption>
</figure>

And it is for this reason that overlays are the true villains: they aren't just filling a business *need*, but a business *fear*. They are successful because doing accessibility the right way is scary. They're taking advantage of the scarcity of knowledge and insecurity of small-to-mid business owners.

We are *partly* to blame for accessibilty fears. But I also want to stress that overlays operate in the same way that AI companies do. [AI companies stoke fears about how "artificial general intelligence" will destroy the world](https://www.truthdig.com/articles/the-madness-of-the-race-to-build-artificial-general-intelligence/) if we don't regulate AI. And guess who gets to regulate AI and contribute to policy and governance on AI? *Those companies*, of course.

In the same way, overlay companies benefit more and more when accessibility gets scarier and scarier. The more someone gets sued (who isn't them) and the more that accessibility practitioners get on people's cases? The better. They deal in fear; it's good business.

## Overlays are ruining my favorite part of computers: personalization

So all of this leads me to the thing that I actually want to talk about: overlays are ruining *personalization*.

Personalization, especially for accessibility, should be about setting up how you want a computer, game, or digital experience to work for you. I love the idea of personalization and have [written about it for a while now](https://www.frank.computer/option-driven-design). Personalization is at the heart of Apple's accessibility with "make it yours" and was the motivation for my latest project, [*Softerware*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18348).

But personalization is a tricky subject. It requires the user to do a lot of work: they have to recognize that something about their experience of an interface is wrong, know what they'd want the interface to do, and then look for or discover how to personalize their experience to suit their needs.

One of the fundamental UX problems with "malleable interfaces" and "end user programming" suffers from these two problems: it's a lot of work to personalize and it can be hard to figure out how to do it.

The immortally brilliant [Adrian Roselli wrote about the problem of "recreating what browsers already do"](https://adrianroselli.com/2016/12/dont-re-create-browser-features.html) when it comes to widgets that increase text size, all the way back in 2016 (wild to think that was nearly a decade ago now).

But one of the major reasons that something as simple as personalizing text size can become an issue is because users likely won't discover that the solution to their problem lives in a little widget somewhere. And guess what? Accessibility overlays hinge on this design. Their entire interface is hidden in a little widget.

Just recently, I was looking up some kind of artificially-sweetened "candy" bar called Hormbles Chormbles and noticed they had an accessiBe overlay. When you click it, the following screen appears:

<figure>
    <img src="https://www.frank.computer/images/hormbles.png" alt="Hormbles Chormbles website with an overlay open. The overlay belongs to accessiBe and has a wide array of options shown, including high level profiles that promise they are 'seizure-safe' to options that claim to enable keyboard and screen reader navigation."/>
    <figcaption>"Hormbles Chormbles?" more like horrible chore-able for anyone who has to use this personalization menu.</figcaption>
</figure>

I think that a few things become a problem with overlays, but based on my [research on *Softerware*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18348), there is one very particular thing that I want to talk about: *persistence*.

Persistence, in terms of personalization, is the idea that you set something once and can forget it. This saves people time and effort and helps enforce your personalization interests automatically.

Overlays, like on the Hormbles Chormbles website, *do* save your settings when you re-visit the site. I select an option, close my browser, revisit the site, and the option is still chosen. "This is great!" you might think. But now I worry about my privacy: *how* did they save these settings? And where?

One of the best parts about how the web is currently designed is that [privacy is paramount and seen as a fundamental human right](https://www.w3.org/mission/privacy/), *especially* for people who have disabilities and/or use assistive technologies.

So how do they track my settings? And do I want a company knowing that I perhaps chose a profile for "seizure-safe"? This information should, ideally, remain private. Users of social media who have epilepsy have been [attacked in the past with seizure-inducing gifs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3411764.3445510). Private information about your health could be used in all kinds of damaging ways (beside this one example). 

So privacy-preserving ways to have persistence of personalization profiles is important (wow, talk about alliteration there).

So overlays are probably using cookies, even though I wasn't asked about which cookies I'd want to save on the website. (And cookie-consent interfaces are already a whole mess to untangle in our modern age.)

But to make matters worse, overlays don't have persistence *across* domains. If I change some options on [Hormbles Chormbles](https://hormbles.com/) and then go over to [Data Literacy](https://dataliteracy.com/), those options don't follow me. What a massive waste of my time and effort.

And of course, overlays don't share data with other overlay companies (which would be a nightmare). Userway, audioeye, and accessiBe are some of the more-notorious overlay companies, but there are actually [quite a lot of different companies that offer overlay-like solutions](https://overlayfactsheet.com/en/). All of them offer different user experiences, capabilities, and methods for "automatically" making something more accessible. Getting them to play nice with each other is probably impossible (since historically this rarely happens between competitors).

I think that overlay companies don't really care whether or not their product actually gets used, they just want business owners to buy it. Adrian Roselli wrote in 2016 about his own work on text-size widgets: [people don't use them at all](https://adrianroselli.com/2016/12/dont-re-create-browser-features.html).

And why would they? How often do I go to a website, stay on it long enough to figure out that the design is painful, look for (and manage to find) a way to alleviate that painful design, and then adjust that design to fit in a way that actually works for me? Again: overlay companies don't care about the fact this user persona doesn't exist in real life (a *persona-non-est*, if you will). But business owners also don't care if the persona exists or not because that is precisely why they paid someone else: they want an accessibility service to do all of the design thinking and solutioning for them so they don't have to.

So overlays *do* take and monitor your data, to some degree. But they don't even do it in a way that saves you time and energy: you have to constantly re-discover and re-perform the labor of fixing a website. And of course, the solutions they offer in the first place are often entirely impotent.

## Why personalization is actually, despite overlays, still awesome
This leads me to my work on personalization and my own interests: I first fell in love with computers *because* of personalization. I built my own desktop computer when I was 10 or so: I picked the parts, bought them myself (with my paper route money from my job my mom got me illegally), and assembled it on my own. Since then, I've been obsessed with computers.

Of course, that was *hardware* personalization. The cool thing about hardware is that it's harder to change after you assemble it. That means your choices up front matter, but also tend to have longer-lasting impact. One set of decisions could last 7 years, if I take good care of that machine. That rules.

And looking over to Apple again, their philosophy for accessibility is still the correct one: we should make our computers *ours*. You can't have *personal computing* without *personalization*.

One of my favorite pieces of all time is by Hickman and Hagerty, "[Standardized access: the tension between scale and fit](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/blog/standardised-access-tension-scale-fit/)." And good accessibility is, as they write, about *fit*. Something that fits perfectly, would be a well-tailored, highly personal artifact or experience. But doing this work takes time and energy, which is why it is always in tension with scale. Scale doesn't have time to solve every issue for all people, so it shoots for means, averages, and majorities whenever possible. [Scale doesn't care about the margins](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08850).

So why is personalization of hardware, an operating system, or in award-winning video games, somehow better than personalization of a website, using an overlay? Well, because overlays have applied personalization to an *impersonal* context. This is because overlay companies are far more interested in scale than real access. They have money to make.

So let's revisit Apple's motto "make it yours:" Overlays don't (and shouldn't) really "know" who you are. And you don't really get to make an overlay your *own*, either. Even the idea of making a single website your own seems absurd. Websites are like other people's houses: they are definitely someone else's space and someone else's curation of information and content. But a computer that you own *should* work for you. This is also why a video game can be personalized too: you buy the game; it's yours. That is enough of a reason to want to personalize it.

Personalization isn't inherently or necessarily *about* ownership, of course. It doesn't require something to be owned. Ownership is just one way that we frame personal things in our larger culture and society, since [capitalism often frames our relationships to things in our lives](https://anarchism.pageabode.com/book/b-3-why-are-anarchists-against-private-property/#secb31).

So it's *persistence* that really matters: persistence of a thing, the continued presence of something situated with us in our lives, is where we derive the desire to personalize. The more we encounter something, the longer we spend time with it, and the more we gain a sense that it *belongs* to us and our identity and experience of the world, the more we will be driven to personalize that thing.

Personalization should be founded in a meaningful, persistent, and personal *relationship* that someone has to an artifact or experience.

This is why in my work on *Softerware*, we argued that we need better infrastructure for interoperability. Right now, our infrastructures primarily concern themselves with scale. But we need infrastructure that is also concerned with *care*, *agency*, and *convenience*. This is why our computers and devices should be where all of the options we find in an overlay should exist. And ideally, we have a "profile" in an ecosystem (not to just harp for Apple here) like Apple: we set up something about ourselves that can persist across devices and every application and experience within that device.

And that way, *every* website we visit won't need an overlay, it instead just needs to ingest your own settings. Whether it is websites, data visualizations, or future interfaces, we can't expect impersonal things to be where our personalization lives and operates.

We need to keep the web *impersonal-but-caring*: it should provide a hospitable environment (be as accessible as possible by default) and then just do the things we've asked of it.
