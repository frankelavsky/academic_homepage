# Hi, I'm Frank Elavsky

<div class="columns" markdown="1">

<div class="intro" markdown="1">
I design and build <a href="https://www.frank.computer/projects/">systems</a> for human interaction. My current work is situated on toolmaking at the intersection of data visualization and accessibility. I'm interested in building better tools that enable us to build interactive systems that make data more accessible to everyone, starting with those historically excluded by poor system design: people with disabilities.

And I have been creating systems for over two decades, starting with <a href="https://www.frank.computer/projects/#Personal:-Braven">designing rpg game systems</a> in middle school. Systems have been a way for me to playfully abstract difficult and complex problems as well as ground me concretely in real, tangible issues.

I create systems because <a href="https://www.frank.computer/blog/2024/11/love-of-systems.html">I love them</a>. I firmly believe that systems designed for rich human interactivity help us not only perform tasks but also enjoy what we are doing. My Ph.D. dissertation, titled "<b>Toolmaking as an intervention on the accessibility of interactive data experiences</b>" (in progress) explores this: "how can the design of tools (defined as a subtype of interactive system applied to a context), enable us to do entirely new things previously impossible, gain more confidence overcoming difficulty, reduce tedium in our work, and help us to actually enjoy interaction?"

I'm presently a PhD Candidate (ABD) at the [Human-Computer Interaction Institute](https://hcii.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am advised by [Dominik Moritz](https://www.domoritz.de/) and [Patrick Carrington](https://www.patrickcarrington.com/) and a member of the [Data Interaction Group](https://dig.cmu.edu/) and [AXLE Lab](https://axle-lab.com/).

In the past, I have had collaborations with wonderful folks at [Highsoft's Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/) ðŸ“Š, [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) <i class="fab fa-apple" aria-label="apple logo"></i>, [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/), [Fizz Studio](https://fizz.studio/), [SRI](https://www.sri.com/research/education-learning/), [UW-Madison's WGNHS](https://home.wgnhs.wisc.edu/), [Northwestern University's MLDS](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/machine-learning-data-science/), [Quansight Labs](https://labs.quansight.org/), [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/), [tldraw](https://tldraw.dev/), and [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/).

## My background

<div class="intro" markdown="1">

I was formerly a [W3C invited expert in data visualization in the ARIA Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/aria/former-participants/#:~:text=Frank%20Elavsky) and currently still volunteer my time with [other efforts](https://www.frank.computer/cv/#service).

Before embarking on a PhD I was a staff design systems engineer at Visa on their Data Experience team and lead contributor to the accessibility efforts of their first open source library, [Visa Chart Components](https://github.com/visa/visa-chart-components). We were able to do some pretty extraordinary things together and I am fortunate to have worked alongside such world-class folks.

Prior to Visa I had a high-octane 2 years at Northwestern University working for Research Computing Services providing data visualization support to over two dozen research projects across a wide range of disciplines. Several of my projects [won awards](https://www.frank.computer/cv/#awards) and have been featured in over 60 research publications (including the privilege of being uncredited in the [2017 Nobel Lecture on Physics](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.90.040502)), 100+ web articles, 4 PhD theses, 4 graduate courses, and [9 textbooks](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Frank+elavsky%22&hl=en&tbm=bks&sxsrf=APq-WBuA3-rFi5BAWgvu7rf_ax78Iee66w:1648824562316&ei=8hBHYsf-Eu-FytMPsZ-B0AI&start=0&sa=N&ved=2ahUKEwjHv9WSjvP2AhXvgnIEHbFPACo4ChDy0wN6BAgBED0&biw=896&bih=931&dpr=2).

In my early career (before Northwestern), I worked in federal policy analyzing large, complex medicare/medicaid datasets and building visualization tools for lawyers and policymakers.
